# API-Integration-and-data-visualization-using-python
This project showcases a practical application of Python to retrieve data from a public API and convert it into meaningful visual representations. The main objective is to process raw API responses and present them through clear, interactive, and visually engaging charts that make it easier to understand current weather conditions and future.
